title: Custom pages
---

Filament allows you to create completely custom pages for resources. To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page SortUsers --resource=UserResource --type=custom
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of your resource directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the resource views directory.

You must register custom pages to a route in the static `getPages()` method of your resource:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        'sort' => Pages\SortUsers::route('/sort'),
    ];
}
```

Any [parameters](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-parameters) defined in the route's path will be available to the page class, in an identical way to [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/rendering-components#route-params).

To generate a URL for a resource route, you may call the static `getUrl()` method on the resource class:

```php
UserResource::getUrl('sort');
```
