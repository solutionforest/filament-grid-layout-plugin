title: Relation managers
---

## Getting started

"Relation managers" in Filament allow administrators to list, create, attach, associate, edit, detach, dissociate and delete related records without leaving the resource's Edit page. Resource classes contain a static `getRelations()` method that is used to register relation managers for your resource.

To create a relation manager, you can use the `make:filament-relation-manager` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title
```

- `CategoryResource` is the name of the resource class for the parent model.
- `posts` is the name of the relationship you want to manage.
- `title` is the name of the attribute that will be used to identify posts.

This will create a `CategoryResource/RelationManagers/PostsRelationManager.php` file. This contains a class where you are able to define a [form](getting-started#forms) and [table](getting-started#tables) for your relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;
use Filament\Resources\Table;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('title')->required(),
            Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ]);
}

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('title'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

You must register the new relation manager in your resource's `getRelations()` method:

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

For relationships with unconventional naming conventions, you may wish to include the `$inverseRelationship` property on the relation manager:

```php
protected static ?string $inverseRelationship = 'section'; // Since the inverse related model is `Category`, this is normally `category`, not `section`.
```

Once a table and form have been defined for the relation manager, visit the [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) page of your resource to see it in action.

### Handling soft deletes

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

You can find out more about soft deleting [here](#deleting-records).

## Listing records

Related records will be listed in a table. The entire relation manager is based around this table, which contains actions to [create](#creating-records), [edit](#editing-records), [attach / detach](#attaching-and-detaching-records), [associate / dissociate](#associating-and-dissociating-records), and delete records.

As per the documentation on [listing records](listing-records), you may use all the same utilities for customization on the relation manager:

- [Columns](listing-records#columns)
- [Filters](listing-records#filters)
- [Actions](listing-records#actions)
- [Bulk actions](listing-records#bulk-actions)

Additionally, you may use any other feature of the [table builder](../../tables).

### Listing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the table, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('role'),
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

## Creating records

### Creating with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the create form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may use the `mutateFormDataUsing()` method, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->mutateFormDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();
    
        return $data;
    })
```

### Customizing the creation process

You can tweak how the record is created using the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasRelationshipTable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CreateAction::make()
    ->using(function (HasRelationshipTable $livewire, array $data): Model {
        return $livewire->getRelationship()->create($data);
    })
```

### Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully created, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the text content of this notification:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User registered')
```

And to disable the notification altogether:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

### Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within an action's lifecycle.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->beforeFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->afterFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->beforeFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->afterFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
```

### Halting the creation process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire creation process:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->before(function (CreateAction $action, RelationManager $livewire) {
        if (! $livewire->ownerRecord->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Editing records

### Editing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also edit pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the edit form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();
    
        return $data;
    })
```

### Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataUsing()` method, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns it modified:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->mutateFormDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['last_edited_by_id'] = auth()->id();
    
        return $data;
    })
```

### Customizing the saving process

You can tweak how the record is updated using the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

EditAction::make()
    ->using(function (Model $record, array $data): Model {
        $record->update($data);

        return $record;
    })
```

### Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully updated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the text content of this notification:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User updated')
```

And to disable the notification altogether:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

### Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within an action's lifecycle.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->beforeFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated from the database.
    })
    ->afterFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated from the database.
    })
    ->beforeFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    })
    ->afterFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    })
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
```

### Halting the saving process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire saving process:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->before(function (EditAction $action, RelationManager $livewire) {
        if (! $livewire->ownerRecord->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Attaching and detaching records

Filament is able to attach and detach records for `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--attach` flag to also add `AttachAction`, `DetachAction` and `DetachBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --attach
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Table;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\AttachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->actions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DetachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DetachBulkAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the attachment modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to attach, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Attaching with pivot attributes

When you attach record with the `Attach` button, you may wish to define a custom form to add pivot attributes to the relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->form(fn (AttachAction $action): array => [
        $action->getRecordSelect(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
    ])
```

In this example, `$action->getRecordSelect()` outputs the select field to pick the record to attach. The `role` text input is then saved to the pivot table's `role` column.

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Scoping the options

You may want to scope the options available to `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user())
```

### Handling duplicates

By default, you will not be allowed to attach a record more than once. This is because you must also set up a primary `id` column on the pivot table for this feature to work.

Please ensure that the `id` attribute is listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

Finally, add the `$allowsDuplicates` property to the relation manager:

```php
protected bool $allowsDuplicates = true;
```

## Associating and dissociating records

Filament is able to associate and dissociate records for `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough` and `MorphMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--associate` flag to also add `AssociateAction`, `DissociateAction` and `DissociateBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --associate
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Table;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\AssociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->actions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DissociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DissociateBulkAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the associate modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to associate, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Scoping the options

You may want to scope the options available to `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user())
```

## Viewing records

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--view` flag to also add a `ViewAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --view
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your relation manager, you can just add the `ViewAction` to the `$table->actions()` array:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Table;
use Filament\Tables;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\ViewAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Deleting records

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

Alternatively, you may add soft deleting functionality to an existing relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Table;
use Filament\Tables;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\RestoreBulkAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}

protected function getTableQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getTableQuery()
        ->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]);
}
```

### Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is deleted:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

### Halting the deletion process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire deletion process:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function (DeleteAction $action, RelationManager $livewire) {
        if (! $livewire->ownerRecord->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Accessing the owner record

Relation managers are Livewire components. When they are first loaded, the owner record (the Eloquent record which serves as a parent - the main resource model) is mounted in a public `$ownerRecord` property. Thus, you may access the owner record using:

```php
$this->ownerRecord
```

However, in you're inside a `static` method like `form()` or `table()`, `$this` isn't accessible. So, you may [use a callback](../../forms/advanced#using-closure-customization) to access the `$livewire` instance:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\Select::make('store_id')
                ->options(function (RelationManager $livewire): array {
                    return $livewire->ownerRecord->stores()
                        ->pluck('name', 'id')
                        ->toArray();
                }),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

All methods in Filament accept a callback which you can access `$livewire->ownerRecord` in.

## Grouping relation managers

You may choose to group relation managers together into one tab. To do this, you may wrap multiple managers in a `RelationGroup` object, with a label:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
            RelationManagers\IndividualsRelationManager::class,
            RelationManagers\OrganizationsRelationManager::class,
        ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Conditional visibility

By default, relation managers will be visible if the `viewAny()` method for the related model policy returns `true`.

You may use the `canViewForRecord()` method to determine if the relation manager should be visible for a specific owner record:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function canViewForRecord(Model $ownerRecord): bool
{
    return $ownerRecord->status === Status::Draft;
}
```

## Moving the resource form to tabs

On the Edit or View page class, override the `hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithForm()` method:

```php
public function hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithForm(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```
